# Valerie Bauer (no official rank)
Agent Bauer is Shadow Service born and bred. As a small child her psionics powers were quickly noted. Valerie's parent did they civic duty and reported it. The documentation never even made it into the system. The SD contact Valerie's parents and worked out an arrangement. Placed into a small, secret boarding school for such powerful children (Die Akademie f√ºr Psionischen Fortschritt - The Academy for Psionic Advancement or APF) Valerie received an excellent education and of course top notch psionic and combat training. At the end she was given the choice to return to normal life or join the Service. Almost everything she ever knew was part of the Service so of course she was proud to join and her parents are proud of their daughter serving the state in such a direct way. She has only loose connections with her parents but visits them consistenly. To her the Service is her real family.

Valerie, now 19, is a newly appointed agent of the Service having only graduated the APF a year ago. She has been on several low stakes missions under guidance but only just received clearance for unsupervised missions. She is young and she knows it and desperate to prove herself. Having been told for years now she could be one of the most powerful psychic operatives in the SD Valerie wants to now prove it to herself and everyone else. She wants to make her commanders, her teachers, and her parent too, pround.

Standing 6ft 2in tall and with dark skin Valerie stands out among her fellow operatives. She is strong but not muscular and is built more like a long distance runner.
