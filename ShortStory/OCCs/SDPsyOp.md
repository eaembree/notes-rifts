# Shadow Service Psyhic Operative
The SD trains its own operatives. They may come to the Service with a variety of skills and life experience and maybe even military and/or combat experience but the Service has its own specialize training. Part of this training molds psychics minds to channel specific, unique, abilities and to train their minds as weapons to work in tandem with the best weaponry Triax has to offer.

(see Triax 1 pg 172 for Intelligence Commado as base)
(see Northern Gun 1 for new class layout. And maybe MOC examples? Or else RUE 236 Tech Officer for MOC examples)
(see Psyscape for psychics)
