# The Shadow Service
## Der Schattendienst (SD)
The Shadow Service, in NGR German Der Schattendienst, abbr. SD, is a secret intelligence and operations service working directly for the heads of Triax Industries. Founded in 38 P.A. after the initial strikes by the Gargoyle Empire's armies overwhelmed Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria. Where the NGR at large ignores magic and tolerates psychics, only with large guardrails on, the top Triax officials, who also hold rank in the NGR government, decided they needed a group dedicated to handling magic an psychics on their own terms. Triax maintains this appearance on the outside but secretly acknowledges the possible dangers psychics and magic users present. They know you can't fight an enemy you know nothing about and somtimes you may have to fight fire with fire. Into this role slips the Shadow Service. The SD is comprised mainly of psychic and extremely talented non-psychic operatives. It does contain a few magic users but the NGR's culture has no mystic traditions. The magic users it does have in its employ are typically outsiders seeking a stable place to live with a few naturally talented mystics and the odd occult researcher. Of course, none of their operatives are listed publicly as having supernatural powers.

The SD's history does not go back very far. Only 50 years ago after a few indicdents in which the NGR and Triax failed badly to prevent supernatural powers from causing widespread damage did, at least, Triax decide it needed to open up a new, if secret, front in the war. The SD typically opperates outside the borders of the NGR keeping the nasty surprises they find well outside the borders of the NGR and dealing with them there, away from civilian casualties. SD operatives have de facto authorization to kill any supernatural creatre or human with supernatural powers which they deem a threat to the NGR. If operating inside NGR territorial boundries they have special clean up crews to deal with the aftermath of taking down any such threat.
