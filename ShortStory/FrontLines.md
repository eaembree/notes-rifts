# Front Lines

The forest is almost silent. Or maybe it just feels that way to her because she can't hear over the sound of blood pounding in her ears and her heavy breath. *Come on. Almost there. Keep it together. You just have to beat him outside the blackout zone. You're half his age you can do this.*

She ran but with a slight limp. The pistol in the right had all but forgotten. Her left hand was pressed firmly against her lower left abdomen. Where the knife had gone in. The wound was deep and for most it would have been fatal for most. She knew would have been gutted if it wasn't for her training. The armor had caught the brunt of the thrust and eventually stopped the blade but vibro knives are nasty. The tip had made it through and possibly nicked something vital judging by the amount of blood. She kept death at bay only by sheer force of her mind. The blood loss could be temporarily arrested but the *pain*... well that was still all there. He had chosen a good spot.

She had thought simply waiting him out. Hiding until he gave up. But *If he makes it past me I'm finished. I need my report to be the first they hear. Who knows what lie he'd spin or how hopeless he would make it all seem.* On the way in it was about two miles out communications had failed. Two miles. She could do that. Must be nearly there already. Reaching the top of the small hill the tree to her right exploded a high pitched *zip*.

The elevator rose up but Felix was somewhere else entirely. Felix Neumann was back in in that forest. Back on that doomed transport mission. The personal guards in full black suits surrounding him towered over Felix, in attitude if not stature. He always felt ashamed when called to these kind of events 

The evelator's *ping* broke his daze. Felix's head sunk a bit lower as the doors slid open directly into President Sperling's private office in Triax's headquarters in Berlin. When the cameras started flashing Felix remembered his duty and stood up straight.

"Obergefreiter Neumann!" Viktoria Sperling shouted over the noise of cameras clicking and reporters with innumerable questions. "Welcome home. I believe I speak for all the people of the New German Republic when I say how glad I am to see you safe."

At the direct insistence of the President's office Felix had seen only restricted duties the last nine months. Of course the missions he undertook still had to *look* good to sell the hero story. His commanding officer had stuck him on a routine patrol job with the occasional rogue gargoyle but nothing serious ever happened there.

"Come, come." Viktoria motioned with her hand. He moved to her side in front of her desk and turned back to face the camera crews. It was all a bit too much and Felix's head was starting to hurt from the stress of this duty, this 'privilege,' they had assigned him. "As you are all aware, Obergefreiter Felix Neumann is one of the great heroes of our military. Such a spectacular and intelligent young man could have chosen any career but chose to dedicate his life to the safety of the citizens of the New German Republic. On first assignment he..." she continued to describe the events that had begun to define his life. The transporation assignment. The ambush. 'His' heroic deeds. It was of course not his first assignment but everyone knew how the media game played and kept quiet about that. That didn't bother him. But the lies about what he did that day? Those were beginning to wear him down. This headache was definately going to need some medication. Viktoria turned her head to face him as she came to the end of the charade of a story.

"And after such a heroic ordeal the people of the New German Republic were mortified to hear tragedy had struck Felix again. Grabbed in a night raid by gargoyle forces we all thought him lost! But he survived behind enemy lines for three days!"

Not quite. it was true he was grabbed in a night raid. One of the enemy's huge Wrecker 'bots had turned up out of nowhere disarmed - literally, its first volley blasted off their weapon arms - him and his partner and then grabbed their Jaeger's and took off. They radioed for backup but it was far enough away the three would be far behind enemy lines before the miltary could scramble intercept craft. A lucky punch from his remaining arm dropped his Jaeger to the ground. His partner in the night's patrol hadn't been seen since. Unlike a cat, he didn't land feet first but on his head. The Jaeger broke the impact but the impact broke the Jaeger. He'd spent the three days fixing the damn thing so he could get back and didn't see a soul, human or otherwise, the entire time.

"But you've all hear enough from me. Let's hear from the man himself." Viktoria gestured to him to take over and to, as he had been instructed, regale the media with a daring tale of risk and stealth and the tragic loss of his teammate. The look in her eyes said 'Make it good.'

Felix stepped forward. In his most self assured voice he said "Thank you Madame President. First I - UGH!" The headache surged to the front of his mind. "I'm sorry. I think I'm feeling a litt bit AAGH!" Felix fell to this knees grasping at this head. The media rushed forward cameras snapping. Two of Persident Sterling guard moved in to block their view while she hurriedly knelt over by him and put a hand on his shoulder.

"What is it? Are you alright? We need to finish this press conference."

"Head... Head! AAAGH!" he replied falling over onto his side.

The President stood grabbing the arm of one of her security guards. "Somebody call an ambulance!" The guard called over the radio and several of the media were on their phone. She hoped to Emergency Services and not to the front desk of whatever news agency they worked for.

Felix started screaming. Viktoria touched him and he was almost burning to the touch. "Something is wrong," she said to the nearest security guard. "He's burning up."

The guard turned as Felix's skin started to glow a pale white. He became incandescent. In a moment of pure reflex the guard pushed President Sterling hard under the desk. She struck the back of her head hard on the edge as she went under. The guard slammed a fist into a hidden button disguised as panelling on the edge of the desk. Metal doors, hidden in the desktop, unfolded and slammed shut just in time.

Felix's incadence gave way to fire and everything not immediately incinerated in what used to be Preident Sperling's executive suite was sent out through her floor to ceiling windows burning in the afternoon light.

The force of the explosion knocked her over onto her left on the other side of the hill. Debris from the tree had embedded itself all down her right side and trickles of blood flowed from each. The knife wound started flowing again when she lost her concentration. Just before the blast she recalled seeing a hollow on the downhill side at the base of that same tree. She rolled a few times to her right, down into the hollow, and again threw her hand over the wound willing it to stop its incessant bleeding.

Checking her pistol, she realized it wasn't here. *Damn it* she thought. *Must have dropped it.*

She knew he wasn't far behind then. His rifle had good range but he hadn't been far behind to start with. A hunter, he know how to keep quiet. What she didn't know is if his chromatoplating was still functional. If she couldn't hear him and couldn't see him he had a distinct advantage. One he didn't know she could almost match. No one outside the Shadow Service knew.

Feldwebel KÃ¶nig arrived at the meeting room fifteen minutes early. He wrinkled his nose and frowned slightly realizing he was already late.
