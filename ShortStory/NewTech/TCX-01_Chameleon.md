# TCX-01 "Chamäleon (Chameleon)"
The TCX-01 (**T**riax **C**hamäleon E**x**periment) armor is an experimental rebranding of the T-11 with installed T-1011-X2 Booster. The onboard computer has been substantially updated with the last 25 years of technological innovation and integrated with the distributed-AI of its experimental chromatoplating creating the first onboard pseudo-AI. The T-11 was taken as the base model for two reasons. FIrst, they are common place which makes the deployment of the TCX-01 easy without unnecessary questions. Second, the Triax scientists are not certain how the onboard AI may evolve over time and in combat scenarios so they're testing the chrompatoplating and computer integration on a relatively low-risk weapon. If they lose control of it a few SD operatives should be able to handle the situation without having to resort to the proverbial, and in this case literal, big guns.

Stats for the TCX-01 are identical to a standard T-11 with T-1011-X2 Booster. The only substantive differences are the chromatoplating the AI which can be assigned simply tasks by the wearer via verbal commands. Examples of such simple commands are communicating an updated sit rep back to headquarters silently while the wear works or monitoring for unusal noises outside the range of human hearing.

Technically the chrompatoplating was inspired by the skin of the octopus. But the techs couldn't quite bring themselves to name the design "The Octopus."
