# A Hero Returns
After a long absence an NGR solider thought dead returns to a hero's welcome. Brought to see the new president the hero explodes, nearly killing the new president. She avoids the fate of everyone else in the room thanks to new security measures put in place after the last president's assassination.
# Discovery
Two specials ops are sent to investiage the area from which the solider returned. One is a hard nosed combat solider used to working long in the field with little to no support. The other is part os a secret team of psychics working for the NGR. They are not publicly acknowledged. The psychic is a recent graduate of their training programs but is by far their strongest psychic who can sense a wide variety of things and has strong physical powers as well.
