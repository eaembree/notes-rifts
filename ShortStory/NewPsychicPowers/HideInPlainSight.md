## Hide in Plain Sight
**Range**: Within 100ft
**Duration**: 1 min per level
**I.S.P.**: 10 per target
**Saving Throw**: Standard
Reaching out with her mind the psychic locations all minds within 100ft she wishes to target. Spending 10 ISP per target she causes the targets not to see a single object or person per use of this power. This power causes the targets minds to block out the particular item/person allowing their mind to fill in the gaps of what should be there. Therefore the object cannot be so large the mind would not reasonably be able to guess what would be behind the object. For example you couldn't hide a skyscraper but you might be able to hide a van. For the purpose of this power a tightly packed group of individuals could be considered a single large object. What can and cannot be hidden in this way is subject to environmental conditions and GM approval.

Objects hidden by this power must be more-or-less stationary. Very small or slow motions can maintain the illusion because the subconscious of the target can quickly adjust. Large or quick motions immediately break the effect this power has over any target able to see the motion. A person hidden might be able to, very slowly, raise a pistol but openning the door of a hidden car would end the effect.

Also, this effect is only visual. It does not sounds made by a hidden object or smells the object gives off. Anything dropped by the target is immediately visible and may end the effect.

Targets which cannot be affected by mental manipulation, such as bots, cameras, and mind-blocked individuals, cannot be affected by this ability.
