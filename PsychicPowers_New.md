## Telekinetic Shockwave
**Range**: Touch, up to 20ft
**Duration**: Instance
**I.S.P.**: 15 (+3 per d10 a number of times equal to character level, see below)
**Saving Throw**: None
With a slight ripple in the air the psychic unleashes a powerful shockwave that sends everything in the area flying. The effect is centered on the psychic but they may choose whether the effect is circular and pushes outward in all directions like an explosion or is directed in only in a specific direction. If the effect is circular anything not nailed down (and possibly even a few things bolted down) are affected by the shockware. If the effect is directed assume the effect is about the size of a human and all objects in a line from the psychic in that direction are affected. The effect is very forceful, roughly equivalent to a jet engine, so the strength of affected characters does not alter this effect. Very heavy objects may be moved less but they must be several thousand pounds for weight to make a difference (GMs discretion).
&nbsp
The force of the effect fades quickly with distance, only affecting objects within 20ft. Creatures at the end of the range are only knocked down or sent sprawling. Anything at touch range may, at the GMs option, be sent flying substantially farther and possibly suffer impact damage as from a fall. In general, and for anything in the mid range, a human sized creature is sent flying 3d10 + 10 feet (again, GM discrection for smaller or larger objects) and knocked down. Rolls this number only once and apply it appropraitely to everything in the affected area. Additionally there is a 25% chance for each weapon or other object an affected character way holding are ripped from their hands and also sent flying, often substantially further.
&nbsp
The psychic may apply additional force to the shockware at a rate of 3 ISP per additional d10 rolled (e.g. 18 ISP for 4d10 + 10, 21 ISP for 5d10 + 10, etc.). The player may only apply ad many additional d10s as their character level. Therefore a first level character can only spend up to 1x3 ISP more (13 total) for a roll of 4d10 + 10 while a tenth level character could spent up to 
up to a total of 10x3 = 30 ISP for 13d10 + 10.
